# Monte-Carlo-Simulations-to-estimate-pi
Approximating the value of pi (22/7) using monte carlo simulations

The value of pi has been approximated using the double integral formula for the area of a circle. Sampling points (x, y) are picked at random, number of samples increased by 10 times across iterations to improve the estimate. The concept is further extrapolated for the case of a sphere. Similar results are obtained.
